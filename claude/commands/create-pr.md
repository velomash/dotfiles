Create a pull request for the changes with the following process:

1. **Check current branch**:
   - Run `git branch --show-current` to check if on main/master
   - If on main or master, create and checkout a new descriptive branch
   - Use format: `type/description-with-hyphens`

2. **Handle uncommitted changes**:
   - Run `git status` to check for uncommitted changes
   - If changes exist, ASK the user: "Should I include these changes in the commit or stash them?"
   - Wait for user response before proceeding

3. **Commit changes** (if user wants to include them):
   - Run `git diff` to show changes
   - Run `git log --oneline -5` to see recent commit message style
   - Stage and commit with proper message format following repository style
   - For sell-alias-org and alias-org, title must match regex: `^((added|changed|fixed|hotfixed|removed|internal|build)(\(.*\)): (.*))|((release|hotfix).*)$`
   - End commit message with:
     ```
